Cooperative context switch for Cortex-M
=======================================

Basic context switcher for Cortex-M. It can be used to implement higher level
functionnalities like coroutines and cooperative multi-threading.

Status

Snapshot, WIP. Need more testing. For now, only target Cortex-M0. It will work
on other Cortex-M but it can be furter optimized for speed and code size.
